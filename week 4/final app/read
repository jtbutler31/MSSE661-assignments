Final App to calculate Black Desert Online food meals by cost of the components

Everything is setup front end and back end but having trouble with submiting a login and registering.

Home.html is the calculator and it calculates the cost of two meals calpheon and balenos with their 5 inputs with a formula that is
used in black desert to craft the food meals.  The formula is correct and it outputs the results of the inputs according to the formula
The web server starts up approriately but cannot currently run the file from localhost:3000 or localhost:4000. You cannot
however run them by clicking on the home register or login html files.
